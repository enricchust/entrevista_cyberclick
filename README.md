# Cyberclick Technical Test

You can find the presentation in the file `Cyberclick Technical Test.pdf`. All the code is contained in `main.ipynb`.

All the questions have been answered in the main notebook except for the "Number of purchases per customer." Since I couldn't associate the orders with a unique customer identifier, I couldn't find a way to extract that information. 

Details about how I approached and answered the other questions are explained in the code.
